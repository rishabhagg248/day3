                    Paragraphs are the building <b>bold text </b>blocks of papers. 
                    Many <strong>strong text </strong>students define paragraphs in terms of length: <i>ilatic text </i>a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, 
                    a paragraph <em>emphasized text</em> half a page long, etc. <mark>marked text</mark> In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among 
                    sentences is what <small>small text</small> constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as <del>deleted text</del> “a group of sentences or a 
                    single sentence that forms a unit” <ins>inserted text</ins> (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a 
                    paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, <sub>subscript</sub> particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be 
                    just one sentence long. Ultimately, a <sup>superscript</sup> paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. 
                    In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

                        Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. 
                        The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to
